**Text Editor**

The Text Editor project emulates a sophisticated text editing environment, leveraging the capabilities of assembly language. Through meticulously crafted subroutines, it offers a comprehensive array of functionalities essential for text manipulation and management.

This robust system allows users to perform various operations seamlessly, including reading, writing, saving, deleting, editing, appending, searching, and generating reports for files. Each of these tasks is encapsulated within dedicated subroutines, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

Utilizing assembly language's low-level control and efficient memory management, this project provides a performant and reliable platform for text editing tasks. Its modular design fosters extensibility, enabling the incorporation of additional features and enhancements with relative ease.

By simulating a text editor environment, this project not only showcases the power and versatility of assembly language but also provides valuable insights into the intricacies of text manipulation and file management at the low-level system level.
